# Medical Diagnosis Using AI

## Overview
Medical Diagnosis Using AI is a data science project that leverages machine learning techniques to assist in diagnosing three critical diseases:
- Heart Disease Prediction
- Lung Cancer Detection
- Parkinson's Disease Detection

This project aims to provide an efficient and accurate system for early disease diagnosis using AI-driven models, helping healthcare professionals make informed decisions.

## Features
- Machine learning models trained on medical datasets for disease prediction.
- Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
- Predictive analytics with high accuracy for medical diagnosis.
- Interactive and user-friendly interface for predictions.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn, pickle
- Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
- Model Deployment: Streamlit

## Dataset
The project utilizes publicly available medical datasets for training and testing the models. Data preprocessing techniques such as feature selection, normalization, and handling missing values are implemented to enhance model performance.
